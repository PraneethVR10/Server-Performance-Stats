3. **Displays Disk Usage**
   - Uses `df -H` to show disk usage across all mounted partitions in human-readable format.

4. **Lists Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage**
   - Uses `ps` to sort and display processes consuming the most CPU.

5. **Lists Top 5 Processes by Memory Usage**
   - Uses `ps` to sort and display processes consuming the most memory.
